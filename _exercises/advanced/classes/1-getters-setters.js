/*

    A class can (just as a prototype) have getters and setters defined to encapsulate data. We have not yet covered
    the syntax, but it's your job now to experiment and find out how this works.

    For this exercise we'll make a Customer object. The customer will have the following properties:
    - id (getter, no setter, can only be set in the constructor)
    - name (getter, setter)
    - age (getter, setter)

    Use _ to indicate the private members _id, _name, and _age

 */

class Customer {
    
}
